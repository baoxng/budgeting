# Budgeting 

## Project Description
As a developer I want to make an expense tracker for users to track their spendings. I want the functionality of the application to allow user to track their money with or without wifi connection. This easy to use application allows a user to enter the name of a transaction and the amount of that transaction in relation to a banking deposit. Live application can be found on [here](https://the-budgeting.herokuapp.com/).

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
